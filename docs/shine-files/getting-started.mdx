# ⚠️Getting Started

SHN files are the base of Fiesta Online content. Most ingame related stuff is added through these files.
Editing these files is therefore the most important part in creating a private server of the game.

## SHN Editors

The variety of editors is pretty big to the current date. While there are some standards that most developers use like
the **Kobalt Editor** or the **SHN Editor v5.3**, there are also alternatives like some older versions of the v5.3 editor
and also custom editors made only for some people.

All currently available SHN editors will be linked below in the Downloads section.

### Downloads

:::note
Downloads with a grey button are considered legacy and are no longer supported by all SHNs.

## Special Editors

Some files require a special editor to be opened. One of these files would be e.g. **QuestData.shn**, since the file
structure differs from any other SHN file. As of now, there are no other _required_ tools, to edit any othe type of
SHN.
